# WP Family Tree Importer

This is a WordPress Import plugin that lets you migrate your WP Family Tree posts from one site to another, while maintaining their family associations. For example, they will keep their post meta for mother, father, and spouse. These family associations were previously lost if you used the regular WordPress Importer to import your WP Family Tree posts.

This plugin is an extension for [WP Family Tree](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-family-tree/) by the the_arv. 

See the [Usage Instructions](http://isabelcastillo.com/free-plugins/wp-family-tree-importer)
